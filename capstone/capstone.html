            <h1>Making a Game Like it's 1983</h1>

                    <p>&emsp;So basically for my senior capstone project I'm going over my development process for making a videogame
                        on an Apple II as well as the neat technical details that go into different aspects of the game like the
                        graphics, sound, and game code. Now you may be asking yourself, "What the actual frick is some 18 year old
                        doing messing around with computers more than twice his age?" To keep it relatively short, I had an
                        opportunity to repair a 1986 Macintosh Plus and I presented the results of my work at an event hosted by the 
                        school's Gifted and Talented Program. This is when I fell in love with old computers and soon after this is when I got ahold of an Apple
                        II+. One thing led to another and now I'm making a videogame. A demo of my videogame will be posted
                        <a href="../Ether.html">here</a> later this month if anyone is interested.

            <h2>PWR Skills</h2>
            <!--<p>For this section, I have to explain different aspects of my project that demonstrate different skills.</p>-->
            <h3>Civic &amp; Global Engagement</h3>
            <p>&emsp;I registered to vote like 3 days ago so I can do what the adults call "contributing to our democracy".</p>
            <img src="Vote.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Self Direction &amp; Personal Responsibility</h3>
            <p>&emsp;Throughout high school, I've worked on many projects computer projects including the Macintosh Plus repair I mentioned earlier as well as 
                basic network connectivity features for a Powerbook computer using a <a href="https://piscsi.org" target="_blank">PiSCSI</a>. As you might 
                imagine, there's not much content about how to accomplish my goals for each of these projects so I had to figure out much of this stuff myself.
            </p>
            <img src="PiSCSI.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>&emsp;Although with many of my problems with my computers I have a general idea of what's wrong, I still occasionally seek conformation from 
                people online to verify I'm on the right track and perhaps provide some helpful insights. <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-plus-repair.2323803/" target="_blank">Here</a>
                is an example of such a case.
            </p>
            <h3>Critical &amp; Creative Thinking</h3>
            <p>&emsp;When writing the code, I have to think about ways to best optimize the speed of program execution and how much space the program
                takes on the floppy disk as well as within the computer memory. There can be many ways to write code so that it accomplishes a task, but
                a well written program is always written to maximize efficiency.

            <h3>Collaberation &amp; Leading by Influence</h3>
            <p>&emsp;</p>
            <h3>Agility &amp; Adaptability</h3>
