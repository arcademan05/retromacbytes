    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
		I'm a high school student in my last year and I'm currently looking for 
        colleges. In the past couple of years, I've grown an interest in retro Apple 
        computers and I've repaired some of the computers I own. As of right now I have 
        the following computers: Apple II+, Macintosh Plus, Macintosh Classic II, and a 
        Powerbook 520. I also like like making software on these old computers and 
        currently I'm working on a video game for the Apple II. This website will have 
        content related to my hobbies and projects. I realize this website is still very 
        barren but I will make updates and improvements. Please come and vist here in the 
        future!
