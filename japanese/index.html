            <h1>Japanese Grammar and Vocabulary Practice</h1>
            <p id = "Question">Welcome to the Japanese practice page. You will be asked the meaning of a Japanese word and your job is to type the English meaning into the text box. Press 'Go' or simply press 'Enter' on your keyboard to submit your answer.
                You will then be told wether your answer is right or wrong. You can either try again, or move onto the next question. Your missed questions and the correct translations will be displayed at the end of the quiz so you will know what to study.
                <br>Press 'Start' to begin. Good Luck!
            </p>

            <p>If you find that this webpage has been beneficial to you and you happen to know me irl, I'd be very apreciative if you would be willing to slip me your spare change every now and then if you happen to have any. Hosting a website like this costs
                some money, so any donations will help me cover those costs.</p>

            <h4>10/04/2025 -</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>User Interface changes</li>
                <li>You can now press 'Enter' (return for some of you Apple folks) on your keyboard to submit an answer instead of having to press Go every time.</li>
                <li>Next button now has functionality. Coincidentally, you also no longer have to refresh the page every time you want a new word because I feel like it. Instead simply press the Next button. The button becomes visible after you attempt to make
                    an answer.</li>
                <li>Fixed a rare bug that's been... bugging me... since I started this website a couple years back. Now, (hopefully) the bottom part of the page should become fixed or static and not obstruct any text at the bottom of the webpage.</li>
                <li>Minor code optimizations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite what is said at the top of the webpage. As of now the quiz doesn't end and therefore incorrect answers won't be displayed at the end. This feature will be added in a near future update so please stay tunned. Also, the 'Finished' button
                still has no functionality.
                <br>Future plans also include adding more vocabulary and options to select which type of vocabulary to study (eg. Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, L8, L13, L4, etc.). I had something else on my mind but I momentarily forgot.
            </p>
            <h4>09/29/2025 -</h4>
            <p>Did a "quick" (It took an hour) update to add the latest vocab from Lesson 14. May be able to practice a bit before the in class quizzes later today (it's 12:37AM).</p>
            <p>Future plans incude adding a sort of check box to select which type of vocab you want to study and from which lesson. Expected when I feel like it. >:D <br> Also, I didn't add the code make it where you don't have to refresh every time. Also to be expected when I feel like it.</p>
            <h4>09/10/2025 -</h4>
            <p>I added compatibility with upper and lower case answers, removed bugs, optimized code.</p>
            <p>My next steps will be to add code to make it where you don't have to refresh the page every time you want a new word.</p>
