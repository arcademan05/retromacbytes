            <h4>9/29/2025</h4>
            <p>Did a "quick" (It took an hour) update to add the latest vocab from Lesson 14. May be able to practice a bit before the in class quizzes later today (it's 12:37AM).</p>
            <p>Future plans incude adding a sort of check box to select which type of vocab you want to study and from which lesson. Expected when I feel like it. >:D <br> Also, I didn't add the code make it where you don't have to refresh every time. Also to be expected when I feel like it.</p>
            <h4>09/10/2025</h4>
            <p>I added compatibility with upper and lower case answers, removed bugs, optimized code.</p>
            <p>My next steps will be to add code to make it where you don't have to refresh the page every time you want a new word.</p>
