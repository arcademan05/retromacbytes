        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I'm a high school student in my last year. In the past couple of years, I've grown an interest in 
            retro Apple computers and I've repaired some of the computers I own. As of right now I have the following 
            computers: Apple II+, Macintosh Plus, Macintosh Classic II, and a Powerbook 520. I also like making 
            software on these computers and currently I'm working on a <a href="Ether.html">videogame</a> for the 
            Apple II. This website will have content related to my hobbies and projects. I realize this website is 
            still very barren but I will make updates and improvements. Please come and vist here in the future! Also, 
            I know my HTML isn't very good right now but I promise it'll get better.</p>
