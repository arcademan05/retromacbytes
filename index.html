            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I'm a college student studying Physics. I also study Japanese language as part of my course of study. I know a lot about computers, new and old, 
                and a bit about computer programming; I've taken entry level courses in both. Originally this website's primary focus was going to be about my various projects 
                on old school computers. Since then, I've moved away from that idea. Now I want to put content about my personal projects, whether they be about old computers, 
                new computers, or random coding projects. As such, I'm going to be moving to a new website (domain name for you tech savvy folks) with a name better fit for my 
                website's focus. This will be happening within a year. For now, I will continue to use this website, then later redirect the link to my new website when that day 
                comes. For now, please enjoy the content currently available and I hope you will visit (even though the site doesn't look very pretty yet) in the future!
