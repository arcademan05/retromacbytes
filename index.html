            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I'm a college student studying Physics. Over the past few years, I've grown an interest in 
                retro Apple computers and I've repaired some of the computers I own. As of now, I have the following retro 
                computers: Apple II+, Macintosh Plus, Macintosh Classic II, and a Powerbook 520. I'm also interested in game 
                development. This website will have content related to my hobbies and projects. I realize this website is 
                still very barren but I will make updates and improvements. Please come and vist here in the future! Also, 
                I know my HTML isn't very good right now but I promise it'll get better.
            </p>
            <p>I'm likely going to be changeing the domain name soon so stay tuned for that.</p>
