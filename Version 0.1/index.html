    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
		I'm a high school student in my last year. In the past couple of years, I've grown
		 an interest in retro Apple computers and I've repaired some of the computers I 
		own. As of right now I have the following computers: Apple II+, Macintosh Plus, 
		Macintosh Classic II, and a Powerbook 520. I also like like making software on 
		these computers and currently I'm working on a video game for the Apple II. This 
		website will have content related to my hobbies and projects. I realize this 
		website is still very barren but I will make updates and improvements. Please 
		come and vist here in the future!
